# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The primary source of truth for the modem-stability investigation is
`Docs/Modem Stability/197_UZ801_PORT_LEDGER_AND_MANDATORY_SOP.md` (a living
document; each §-entry is a changelog entry). This file records commits that
modify that ledger, for quick reference.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Pending / next

- **Sequenced ~900 s fatal investigation (approved plan)** — user chose order
  1 → 2 → 3:
  1. **RF / interference lead** — DONE (§112.40): the RF/meas layer is the first
     LTE sub-layer to stop, but state-dependent and the F3 does not say why.
  2. **ML1 SERV-MEAS-RSP reply path** — DONE (§112.41): the reply is *downstream*
     of the ML1-wide stall — the producer (`FUN_c01bc8e0`) never runs
     (`slot[+0x01]=0` in 7/7 dumps); no new root.
  3. **New live instrument** for the ML1-side counter (ledger §112.42 pending;
     needs a pre-registration + device deployment).
- **Cleanup patch (carried over, DEFERRED)** — fold the `hang_probe_t4` /
  `f3cap` / `coredump-enable` blocks out of `/etc/rc.local`. Deferred by user
  decision: it fixes no crashes and removes the on-device safety net for a
  possible patch-831 regression.
- **`a2_pin` default decision (carried over, open)** — whether the shipped image
  should default `a2_pin=1` (currently opt-in via uCI set; shipped config sets
  it). A design/risk question: `a2_pin=1` suppresses the cold-boot
  `a2_power.c:1189` fatal but is a **mitigation, not a root-cause fix**
  (§112.24/§112.28); it holds the modem's A2 power-control pin across pre-emptive
  SSRs.

### Changed — modem stability ledger

- **§112.41 (phase 2, ML1 SERV-MEAS-RSP reply path)** — traced the chain
  (`FUN_c02fda90` armer → CNF gate `FUN_c01bc934` → ready-writer `FUN_c01bc8e0`);
  the ready counter `slot[+0x01]` is **0 in 7/7** fatal dumps, so the producer
  never ran and the reply was never produced. Verdict: the reply path is
  **downstream of the ML1-wide stall — no new root**. Armer gate
  `DAT_c1e143ca=0` in 7/7 (normal path). Read-only, offline.
- **§112.40 (phase 1, RF/interference lead)** — re-confirmed item 71's RF
  collapse with a new tool `scratch/rf_timeline.py`; found the
  `rflte_core_rxctl` RX gain/freq-comp values are **always 0** (no retune storm);
  showed the collapse is **state-dependent** (876 vs 12 RF records across the two
  wedges). Verdict: **precursor**, cause unknown; the fatal-run RF-vs-assert
  ordering is not pinnable from the multi-session wrapping captures. Read-only,
  offline.
- **`be50e56`** — Add this CHANGELOG.md (Keep-a-Changelog format) documenting
  commit `03bbc17` and the prior §112.37–§112.39 series. Doc 197 remains the
  primary source of truth; this file is a quick-reference index.
- **`03bbc17`** — §112.39 sync note: findings folded back into §112.38.
  - Added a "Sync with §112.38" subsection to §112.39 recording that its
    findings were carried back into §112.38 (commit `c1ad1d9`): the MCPM row #1
    7-dump coredump confirmation (scratch zeroed 7/7, `q6pcvote` LIVE
    1060-1647), the OPEN-section `rpm.sync` RULED OUT, and the ML1-side
    SERV-MEAS-RSP ctx0 watchdog (items 84-86/100/102) listed as the surviving
    candidate.
  - Updated §112.39's Achieved/Expected table last row to cross-reference
    §112.38's OPEN section and items 84-86/100/102.
  - Net state recorded: the `rpm.sync` LPR park axis is **CLOSED**; the
    firmware-timer axis remains **exhausted** (§112.38); the one open question
    — *what stops the ML1 SERV-MEAS-RSP reply path at ~902 s* — is a
    causal-mechanism question, not a timer-limit question.

### Prior commits in this series

- **`c1ad1d9`** — §112.38 update: fold §112.39 ML1 counter findings back in.
  MCPM row #1 coredump-confirmed 7/7; OPEN section `rpm.sync` RULED OUT, ML1-side
  SERV-MEAS-RSP ctx0 watchdog added as surviving candidate; Achieved/Expected
  and SOP/Tools updated.
- **`b9275ad`** — §112.39: `rpm.sync` LPR park CLOSED — `q6pcvote` LIVE, MCPM
  scratch zeroed, not a hang. Read-only disassembly + 7-dump coredump synthesis.
- **`24e1001`** — §112.38: firmware timers/watchdogs complete inventory — three
  distinct ~902 s watchdogs (MCPM INERT, ML1 state-50ms FALSIFIED items 85/86,
  a2_power >900 EVALUATED); no untested lever.
- **`fe1653b`** — §112.37: PSCI/cpuidle axis CLOSED — §112.29 "cluster
  unreachable" retracted; cpuidle sub-lever already falsified (H-IDLE); no
  remaining reversible lever.
